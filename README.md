### Treehouse FSJS Project 2 - List Pagination and Filtering

<hr>

#### Project Description:
In this project, you'll enhance the usability of a web page that is displaying way too much information all at once. Long lists don't make for a good user experience on a web page. To make it easier for the user to find information and read the page, you'll add to this project a popular web development technique known as "pagination".

While making these improvements, you'll adhere to an important development principle known as "progressive enhancement". Which in this case basically just means that you'll add JavaScript to enhance the web page, without making the web page dependent upon the JavaScript that you are adding.

In other words, you'll add JavaScript to paginate and improve the project, without altering the project in such a way that JavaScript becomes required to use or view the web page.

With "progressive enhancement" in mind, you'll write the code to take this default list of 54 students and break it up into separate pages that display only 10 students at a time. Additionally, you'll programmitcally add buttons to the bottom of the page that allow users to navigate through the list, 10 students at a time.

Your pagination solution should be dynamic, meaning it will work for any list containing any number of items.
