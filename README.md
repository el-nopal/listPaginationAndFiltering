### Treehouse FSJS Project 2 - List Pagination and Filtering

<hr>

<b> Project Description: </b>

To enhance user experience, I used the technique of pagination. This allows the user to find information quicker and easier to read.
While using the technique of pagination, I adhered to the development principle of progressive enhancement. This principle enhances the web page but doesn't make the web page dependent on JavaScript.
The default list of 54 students has been broken down to 10 students each page. Pagination made the page dynamic and will work with any list containing any number of items.
